Machine learning models to predict banking customer churn. 
It is evident that acquiring new customer is much more costlier than retaining existing one. Predicting customer churn enable us to analyze deeper into the variable causing customer to churn, that inturn helps us in formulating strategy to increase customer retentions. We developed classifier models: decision tree, naive bayes, xg-boost and deep learning neural networks models using historical data to predict banking customers' churn. Based on the performace metrices, we evaluate models.XG boost performed better. We also group our customers into several bivariate clusters using k-means clustering, which we used to analyze the profile of churning and non-churning customers. From the cluster analysis, We have found that churn rate is very high in customers of age above 35, which is a serious concern.
